Every app needs email sending capabilites weather it's for password reset or invitations or whatever - appwrite has everything prepared for it, we just need to use the given options. 

Because SMTP servers are hard to setup and maintain, we'll use a third party API to provide our SMTP needs.

## Mailgun side settings

Since [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) is super easy to setup and use, we'll use it as our SMTP provider. 

After a successful registration:
1. Navigato to sending -> overview
2. Select SMTP
3. Those are the credits that are needed for us in the later setup

E.g.:

I already reset this password, so no worries about that ðŸ˜Š

## Appwrite setting

After grabbing our settings we need to setup for appwrite:

1. Navigate to your installation forlder for me it's in `~/appwrite`
2. Start to edit your `.env` in the folder
3. After you've edited the file restart the appwrite compose

You'll need to edit: `_APP_SMTP_HOST`, `_APP_SMTP_PORT`, `_APP_SMTP_SECURE`, `_APP_SMTP_USERNAME` and `_APP_SMTP_PASSWORD`. 

Optionally you can also edit: `_APP_SYSTEM_EMAIL_ADDRESS` - this is the sender's email, for this short example I left as is. 

E.g.:
![env (1).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1644870038701/UmDqx7Mqv.png)

To restart appwrite you first need to stop the containers:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

Then after the containers are stopped - restart it:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

These commands should be executed from your appwrite installation folder, for me: `~/appwrite`. 

Aaand that's it, you've successfully setup email sending for your appwrite. To try out go to your console, select a project, settings and invite a new member for it. After you've sent the email mailgun should show something like this:

I hope you've found this quick article about email setup useful. ðŸ˜Š
